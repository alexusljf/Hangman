# Hangman

Welcome to my Hangman Game! <br>
This game uses a random word API to fetch random words each round, enhancing replayability.<br>
Players only have 7 wrong tries before the game ends.

## Tools Used

* Random Word API: https://github.com/mcnaveen/Random-Words-API
* React
* CSS
* GitHub Pages

Hangman images were drawn in Paint :)

## To-Do

- [] Add Difficulty Options (Customise Number of Tries)
- [] Add a pop-up message for incorrect input
