# Hangman

Welcome to my Hangman Game! <br>
This game uses a random word API to fetch random words each round, enhancing replayability.<br>
Players only have 7 wrong tries before the game ends.

## Tools Used

* Random Word API: https://random-word-form.herokuapp.com
* Dictionary API: https://dictionaryapi.dev/
* React
* CSS
* GitHub Pages

Hangman images were drawn in Paint :)
